# bash-prompt
bash prompt that tells you what git repo you're using, and if there are untracked/uncomitted changes

when entering a git managed directory, the respository name will become part of the prompt, and will change colour based on any untracked (red) or uncommited changes (yellow)


to use the prompt, copy it into ```~/.profile``` or ```~/.bashrc```
